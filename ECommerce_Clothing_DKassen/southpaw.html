	<p>Billy Hope (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a one-time boxer at the height of his fame, with a fancy house and a loving family, and despite his career, his wife Maureen (Rachel McAdams), pleads for him to quit so he can spend time with his daughter Leila (Oona Laurence). He announces his retirement during an event, but tragedy strikes shortly thereafter that involves Maureen murdered and Leila taken away. Broke and drowning his sorrows in dangerous drugs, the only way he can stay afloat and win back his family is another pro boxing match.
